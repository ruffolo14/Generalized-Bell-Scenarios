# Generalized-Bell-Scenarios

This repository was created with the aim of save the data from our research on the field of Generalized (or Extended) Bell Scenarios. It's basically a collection of polytope informations, like list of vertices or list of facets as inequalities. All the results are obtained using the PANDA software for polyhedral transformations [1].
Just to know, here we have a list of possible names and meanings:
* *NSND* - Nonsignaling Nondisturbing polytope. It's the polytope of all behaviors **p** that are nonsignaling between the parts and nondisturbing in each part
* *LND* - Local Nondisturing polytope. It's the polytope of all behaviors **p** that have a LHV model with nondisturbing response funcions for each part. It's facets are *Extended Bell Inequalities* (for precise meaning and definitions, see [2]).
* *2-ncicle scenario* - It's the measurement scenario where Alice realizes two dichotomic measurements and Bob realizes n dichotomic measurements ciclic compatible. Examples of such scenarios are 2-triangle, 2-square [3] and 2-pentagon [4] ,etc.
* *LNC* Local Noncontextual polytope. It's the polytope of all behaviors **p** that have a LHV model with noncontextual response fuctions for each part. It's usually called the *Classical Polytope* also, because it recovers our reasoning for something that behaves classically.
